# Generating faces with Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)
This repo contains an implementation for a DCGAN using PyTorch.

## The data
I used the CelebFaces dataset to train the network.\
Please check out the dataset on kaggle, [here](https://www.kaggle.com/jessicali9530/celeba-dataset).\
In order for the code to run and fetch the dataset, you have to put your kaggle api key.

The repo also contains a keras implementation of the DCGAN, but the PyTorch version is more formatted and clean.
